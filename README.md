## Sustainable Use of Medical Apps

This repository contains the supporting materials for the paper "Impact of Progress Visualization and User Feedback on the Long-Term Usage of Mental Health Apps" by Julian Bissinger, Paul Krzcal, Lisa Schiedel, and Aïsha Schuhegger.

### Overview

The paper examines how progress visualization (PV) and user feedback (UF) influence the sustained usage of mental health apps. The analysis is based on the data contained in the CSV file "ImportantStudies.csv" and the corresponding R Markdown script "ImportantPlots.Rmd". 

### Contents

- **Data**: The CSV file `ImportantStudies.csv` contains the data used for analysis.
- **Scripts**: The R Markdown script `ImportantPlots.Rmd` generates the visualizations and analyses presented in the paper.
- **Figures**: The resulting plots can be found in the `\figures` folder.

### Project Details

This research was conducted as part of a university project (from Universität Heidelberg and Hochschule Heilbronn), developed in response to a `240320_Call for papers-PBMI-SoSe24.pdf` proposal.

### How to Use

1. **Data**: Review the data in `ImportantStudies.csv`.
2. **Analysis**: Run the `ImportantPlots.Rmd` script to reproduce the analyses and generate the visualizations.
3. **Figures**: Access the generated plots in the `\figures` folder.
